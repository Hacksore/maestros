### Always start with an issue

If you'd like to help with an existing issue, please mention that you'd like to be assigned before working on the issue so we can make sure we don't have multiple folks working on the same thing.

This guidance also applies if you'd like to contribute a major pull request. Communicate on an issue first to see if your work is likely to be accepted before working on large, "unknown-to-maintainers" pull requests.

## Reporting an issue

If you're running into problems with Maestros, feel free to let me know. You'll find a few guidelines below.

### First, is your issue an opinion?

The workflows, strategies, and practices in Maestros are a happy path that I (Anthony) have built up over time. There are many great tools with overlapping concerns that may or may not make it into Maestros. The goal is to provide the highest value happy path that I know of that is some balance of:

- Easy to explain
- Easy to use
- Powerful

We do have a "Tools" section where we run through specific tooling for specific use cases. When requesting something you have a big opinion about, be careful to follow these three guidelines.

This isn't to say that I think I have it all figured out. If you think there is some pain that we can resolve with the existing tooling that you see me recommending, feel free to give me a nudge!

### Filing an issue

Please follow the issue templates as closely as possible on this GitHub repo.
