# Turbo Studio

## An unofficial visualizer for your Turborepo

TODOs:

- Remove Next.js canary in favor of pinned version
- Any perf improvements I can make on graph drawing? (dagre sometimes gets the spacing wrong, as well)
- Do I want to make a deployed version?
- Ability to change the cd ../.. bit for command
- dagre gives weird paint dimensions sometimes? Particularly on more complex graphs.
- README
