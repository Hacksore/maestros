ogDescription: Using the Internal Package pattern in a monorepo.

Using the knowledge we gained in the [Internal Packages](/monorepos/packaging/internal) and [Just-In-Time Packages](/monorepos/packaging/jit), we can easily create packages with multiple entrypoints.

## Motivation

There could be several reasons that you'd want to create your package with multiple entrypoints:

- **Runtime Constraints**: In some cases, a Node package that makes it into the browser bundle can crash your application since it won't have server-side only APIs available. By splitting the imports into two separate entrypoints, you can create server-friendly and browser-friendly entrypoints.
- **Organization**: There are often opportunities to bring clarity to your code by splitting your imports amongst multiple entrypoints. We'll give you an example by building a UI component library down the rest of this page.

## Add an entrypoint to an Internal Package

To pick up where we left off at the end of the [Internal Packages](/monorepos/packaging/internal) page, we had a transpiled package that we could share to the rest of our workspaces with one entrypoint.

To give this package another entrypoint, we'll only need to make a few small changes.

### Add some source code

Let's add another file to our source code for a couple icons:

```tsx filename="packages/ui/src/icons.tsx"
export const Circle = (props: SVGAttributes<SVGElement>) => {
  return (
    <svg {...props} viewBox="0 0 50 50">
      <circle cx="25" cy="25" r="20" />
    </svg>
  );
};

export const Square = (props: SVGAttributes<SVGElement>) => {
  return (
    <svg {...props} viewBox="0 0 50 50">
      <rect x="10" y="10" width="30" height="30" />
    </svg>
  );
};
```

### Add the `tsup` entrypoint

Next, we'll need to make `tsup` aware of the new entry to your package.

```js filename="packages/ui/tsup.config.js" note="We're using JavaScript here but will still get great autocomplete. ðŸ˜„"
export default defineConfig((options) => ({
  entry: [
    "src/index.tsx",
    // focus(1:1)
    "src/icons.tsx"
    ]
  ...
}));
```

### Add a new to `exports`

Last, we'll add the entrypoint to our `package.json`.

```json filename="packages/ui/package.json"
{
  "name": "@repo/ui",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
      "import": "./dist/index.js"
    },
      // focus(1:4)
    "./icons": {
      "types": "./dist/icons.d.ts",
      "import": "./dist/icons.js"
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

You'll now be able to import from the entrypoint using:

```tsx filename="apps/web/src/index.tsx"
import { Circle } from "@repo/ui/icons";
```

## Adding an entrypoint to a Just-In-Time Package

To pick up where we left off at the end of [the Just-In-Time Package page](/monorepos/packaging/jit), we can add another entrypoint in two quick steps.

### Add some source code

Let's add another file to our source code for a couple icons:

```tsx filename="packages/ui/src/icons.tsx"
export const Circle = (props: SVGAttributes<SVGElement>) => {
  return (
    <svg {...props} viewBox="0 0 50 50">
      <circle cx="25" cy="25" r="20" />
    </svg>
  );
};

export const Square = (props: SVGAttributes<SVGElement>) => {
  return (
    <svg {...props} viewBox="0 0 50 50">
      <rect x="10" y="10" width="30" height="30" />
    </svg>
  );
};
```

### Add a new entry to `exports`

Now, we'll create another entrypoint to our code so that other applications and packages can import it directly.

```json filename="packages/ui/package.json"
{
  "name": "@repo/ui",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "exports": {
    ".": "./src/index.tsx",
    //focus(1:1)
    "./icons": "./src/icons.tsx"
  },
  "typesVersions": {
    "*": {
      "*": ["./src/index.tsx"],
      //focus(1:1)
      "icons": ["./src/icons.tsx"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `"exports"` field make the code available for compliation while the `"typesVersions"` field makes the type definitions available.

You'll now be able to import from the entrypoint using:

```tsx filename="apps/web/src/index.tsx"
import { Circle } from "@repo/ui/icons";
```
